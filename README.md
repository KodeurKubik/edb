# EDB
Create any Discord bot in simple commands!

EDB create you the template of a Discord bot and you finish the code! Templates of commands are available too and you can publish more commands by creating a pull request!

## Requirements
- You need to have bash installed to run the index.sh file so Linux or Mac is already installed;
- JQ for the JSON in the requests, to install you can use [brew](http://brew.sh/) "brew install jq";
- Node.JS V > 16.0.0;
- NPM V > 8.0.0;

The Discord.js module will be installed when the project is created, no worries about that ;)
**ALL THE REQUIREMENTS ARE INSTALLED BY USING THE 'source ./init.sh' COMMAND**

Then, the command 'edb' will be created on your computer.


## Uninstalling

If you want to uninstall EDB for any reason, go to the EDB folder and use the 'source ./uninstall.sh' command.
It will remove the edb command and delete the entire content of the EDB folder. Then, just move to trash the EDB folder.
